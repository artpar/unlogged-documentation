# Code Coverage

Getting code coverage number above 90% is often challenging and takes a lot of time and effort. 

Unlogged highlights the lines of code executed and offers you the feedback on code coverage.

The code coverage won't increase unless you save the candidates with assertions. 

Note the **potential uptick in the coverage** number on the replay window.


## Tracking 

You can check the progress in the tab ```Code Coverage``` every time you save different candidates.

Track class coverage, method coverage and line coverage in this tab.

!!! tip
	The code coverage is shown even when you use external tools such as Postman, or Swagger to execute a method through an http end point.
