# Call Java Methods Directly

To test a ```java``` method, you either have to write a unit test, or expose an http end point and then ```F8```/step over till you reach your method. 

We connect a lot with this meme from [monkeyuser](https://www.monkeyuser.com/2017/step-by-step-debugging/)

## Direct Invoke 

The code coverage won't increase unless you save the candidates with assertions. Check the potential uptick in the coverage number on the replay window.

You can check the progress in the tab ```Code Coverage``` every time you save different candidates.

Track class coverage, method coverage, and line coverage in this tab.

!!! tip
	The code coverage is shown even when you use external tools such as Postman, or Swagger to execute a method through an http end point.
